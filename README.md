# rand-geo-data
This repo holds everything for my MSc in Data Science project. The project involves the creation of a Python tool to generate realistic random spatial data for use in assessment

## Planned Functionality:

* Generation of realistic random spatial data:
  * Data points to be distributed in a random fashion that behaves like real-world spatial data points (patterns, clustering, distance to roads/borders/etc.)
  * Points will have randomly generated realistic meta-data, such as names and various attributes, depending on the type of points being generated
* Exporting of data to a GeoJSON format
* Exporting of data to a PostgreSQL format
